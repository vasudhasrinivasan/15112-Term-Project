My project is named 'Escape'. The purpose of this game is to essentially solve and escape a randomly generated maze. Features of the maze such as the maze generating algorithm, size, and color depend on the choices the player makes when selecting from the different levels and options. 

To run the project, the user simply needs to run the main file named "EscapeFile.py" from a folder also containing the cmu112_graphics.py file as it is imported by the main file (which is from http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/notes/notes-animations-part1.html). 

No external libraries were used to make my project (only uses Tkinter).

No shortcut commands exist as player can choose between different modes. However, a list of features (such as seeing the solution made  to the maze or changing the player's color) can be seen on the instructions page, which shows up when player presses 'I' while in a maze mode.
